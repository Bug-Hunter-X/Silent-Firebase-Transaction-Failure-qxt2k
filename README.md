This repository demonstrates a silent transaction failure bug in Firebase and its solution. The bug occurs when the transaction function throws an unexpected error that is not properly handled, resulting in a failed transaction without any error details being provided. The solution involves adding robust error handling within the transaction function to catch and log all potential exceptions.
